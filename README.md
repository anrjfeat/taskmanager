This repository contains a Django Project named Task Manager, there is an app in the project named task.
We can add the new records of the task with the help of file postapp.py and we can view the various task all at once with help of getapp.py.
A new task should have three attributes : name, description and email. They need to be inserted in postapp.py which is a python file and we can run the python file and the record will be added in the database.
To view the records we have to run getapp.py which is again a python file and we will get the data in form of a JSON.
